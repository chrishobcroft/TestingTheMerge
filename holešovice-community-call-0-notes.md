Some context is required from this post: 

Notes and actions from this call:

- Establish compatibility of existing wallets, contracts, factories, faucets, protocols, explorers etc. with Verklised-EL. Anyone can run local version from https://github.com/holesovice-testnet/go-ethereum, test their favourite infrastructure (please report bugs as issues in the projects' repos, e.g. tell projects that their stuff has/hasn't been demonstrated to work with Verkle Trees). Through this, we can hopefully also refine the installation instructions to help @matlemad get up and running with his RPi.

- Run one (or more) test-launch(es) for a testnet prior to EthBerlin3. Here is where to start to build Infrastructure Operator community, and also prepare the process and presentation for launching during the opening ceremony of EthBerlin3. This one feels like it needs some coordination, but @mrq1911 feels like a key resource here, who will likely need our support.

- Seek to engage the devOps team at the EF (please @havelm to weave the threads?), in order to provide a handover of the maintenance of some of the more mature parts of their "PublicTestnetFactory" stack, freeing them up to continue to evolve.

- Seek to engage other projects/people in partnership, e.g. EthereumOnArm, go-ethereum, ethersphere/Swarm, go-livepeer, Gnosis Safe, The Graph, OpenZeppelin, Obol, Bordel, ENS, Chainsafe/Lodestar, @codemunkee, WalletConnect/pedrouid, cryptostats/David Mihal, Fauceth/ligi, and so on.

- Target the launch of the first "proper" testnet, with index [0], and with networkID 17000 0, in time for EthBerlin, perhaps as part of the opening ceremony. Chris to engage with @schoedon and/or other souls planning EthBerlin3.

- Then, see who wants to do one (or more) of the following:
a) keep Holešovice[0] running as a long standing testnet
b) launch Holešovice[1]: the 2nd in the series of Holešovice Project testnets.
